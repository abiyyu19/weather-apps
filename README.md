# Install Application on your local device

1. Clone this repository using the 'git clone https://github.com/abiyyu19/weather-apps.git' command in the terminal.
2. Install all project dependencies by running the 'flutter pub get' command.
3. If you wish to Sign In or Sign Up using a Google account on an Android device, please request to add your local machine's SHA1 and SHA256 to my Firebase account. You can find the SHA1 and SHA256 credentials on Windows using the following terminal command: 'keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore %USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore'. Insert the default password 'android' if you haven't changed it.
4. For Sign In or Sign Up using a Google account on an iOS device, add 'com.googleusercontent.apps.527895033367-p6jhd4ga7qv1ekussggkhkgvi063kinf' to your Runner workspace using Xcode. Please note that I haven't tested the Google Sign-In feature on iOS as I don't have access to a Mac device.
5. To run the project locally, use the 'flutter run' command in the terminal.
6. For Email and Password login, use 'test@gmail.com' with the password 'test123'. Alternatively, you can use the dummy phone number '+62 112 2334 4556' and OTP '123456' to test login using a phone number.
